For this assignment, I wanted to create dynamic text. 
I started off by dividing my sentence into the seperate words and spacing them out. Then, using velocity, I made the text move along the y-axis. 
I was a bit confused with the order of the code. However, I eventually played around with it a bit, and it eventually started to work.
